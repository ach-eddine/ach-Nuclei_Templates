My custom Nuclei templates for various vulnerability scanning use cases.


# Custom Nuclei Templates
This repository contains a collection of custom [Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) templates for vulnerability scanning across different web and network services.


The goal is to provide a set of high-quality, regularly updated templates tailored for specific security use cases, including:
- Web application vulnerabilities
- Cloud security misconfigurations
- Network-level vulnerabilities
- API security checks

## How to Use These Templates
Clone the repository and add the templates to your Nuclei workflow:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nuclei-templates.git
nuclei -t /path/to/nuclei-templates/
